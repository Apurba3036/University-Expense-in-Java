At X University there are two types of students: on campus students and online students. On campus students are categorized as resident (r) and non-resident (n) depending on whether they reside in the campus dormitory. The tuition fee without course fee for on campus resident student is 30000 taka and non resident it is 24000 taka. Some on campus students are enrolled in different professional courses offered by the university. The professional course fee are different for different courses. For networking skill development it is 5000 taka, for software developing it is 4500 taka etc. The students who are studying online they don't need to pay any extra money rather than the course fee. The course fee per credit is 3500 taka. 
Implement the above scenario by creating a JAVA project where there will be minimum 5 classes where each class will contain at least 2 OOP features.
